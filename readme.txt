Displays a virtual, on-screen keyboard to enter the wordpress password in a safer way, for example in internet cafés.

== Description ==

**This plugin is no longer supported**

Optionally displays a virtual, on-screen keyboard to enter the password in more safe way, for example in internet cafés. Entering the password using an on-screen keyboard reduces the risk keyloggers can steal the password. The on-screen keyboard will be shown after clicking on the keyboard icon next to the password input box. Some options can be set, for example if a numeric keypad should be shown.

Please report any issue you have with this plugin on the [support page](http://blog.bokhorst.biz/1826/computers-en-internet/wordpress-plugin-login-virtual-keyboard/ "Marcel's weblog"), so I can at least try to fix it.
If you rate this plugin low, please [let me know why](http://blog.bokhorst.biz/1826/computers-en-internet/wordpress-plugin-login-virtual-keyboard/#respond "Marcel's weblog").
